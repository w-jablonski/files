# Polish+English Keyboard Character Layout "odczaj"

This layout is meant to be reasonably comfortable for typing text in both Polish and English. 
What's perhaps unique is that in its basic version it leaves lowest pinkeys blank -- as I believe putting modifiers on these is a better choice.

Some defining features include inward rolls on some frequent-est Polish bigrams like IE, RZ, SZ, CZ, DZ. 
Others are a lateral stretch on HE (Colemak style) and same-finger HA, neither of which I find uncomfortable.
