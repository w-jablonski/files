### Layout 1

What's perhaps unique to this layout, its original version (and the one I use) has the lowest pinkies blank — I have modifiers there and I believe this is a good idea. For one, it allows Ctrl+XCV without finger-braking.

Some circumstances that shaped this up: 
* Lowest pinkies are to be left blank 
* I am using a straight grid keboard (not ergonomic or columnar stagger) so upper pinkies are pretty hard to reach
* My right hand sits at an angle (while the left is more straight). This makes the HE lateral stretch and H>A slide comfy. However, G and Q are now harder to reach

Some decisions:
* For simplicity, vowels are put together and AEIO on the home row. The frequent IE shall be a comfortable roll with strong fingers
* Frequent bigrams RZ, SZ, CZ, DZ are inward rolls and NSRT are chosen for home row. Put together, this forces Z to the inner column and then T with it, as TZ is rare
* Hands are kept "up". Dropping to bottom row, especially with index and middle finges, feels slow. This runs against the "curl" principle as I understand it, and touches C, Z, L, H
* SZCZ needs to be comfy. This is subtle but for one, S and C are on different columns
* X, C, V cannot be put next to where they originally were. I have Ctrl+XCV mapped to their original positon, and hitting e.g Ctrl+C to accomplish Ctrl+V would feel weird





### Layout 2</p>
<!-- ... 

include inward rolls on some frequent-est Polish bigrams like IE, RZ, SZ, CZ, DZ. 
Others are a lateral stretch on HE (Colemak style) and same-finger HA, neither of which I find uncomfortable.
