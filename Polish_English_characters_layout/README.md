# Polish+English Keyboard Character Layouts <br><br>Polsko-angielskie układy znaków na klawiaturze

### Layout 1

What's perhaps unique to this layout, its original version (and the one I use) leaves the lowest pinkies blank — I have modifiers there and I believe this is a good idea. For one, it allows Ctrl+XCV without finger-breaking. 
See my whole setup at a separete repo (WIP). See the layout's [statistics](https://cyanophage.github.io/playground.html?layout=qdczv%3Dguyx%3Bnsrtlhaeio%27kwmb*fp%2C.j%5C%2F-&mode=ergo&lan=polish&thumb=l) at the Cyanophage's excellent layout playground.

Some conditions that affected the layout: 
* Lowest pinkies are unavailable
* I am using a straight grid keboard (not ergonomic or columnar stagger) so upper pinkies are pretty hard to reach
* My right hand sits at an angle (while the left is more straight). This makes the HE lateral stretch and H>A slide comfortable. However, G and Q are now harder to reach

Some decisions:
* For simplicity, vowels are put together and AEIO is the home row. The frequent IE shall be a comfortable roll with strong fingers
* Frequent bigrams RZ, SZ, CZ, DZ are inward rolls and NSRT are chosen for home row. Put together, this forces Z to the inner column and then T with it, as TZ is rare
* Hands are kept "up". Dropping to bottom row, especially with index and middle fingers, feels slow. This runs against the "curl" principle as I understand it, and touches C, Z, L, H
* SZCZ needs to be comfy. This is subtle but for one, S and C are on different columns
* X, C, V cannot be put next to where they originally were. I have Ctrl+XCV mapped to their original positons, and hitting e.g Ctrl+C to accomplish Ctrl+V would be weird

### Recommendation

Another person is working on a Polish+English layout and their results seem to be much better than mine so far. As it seems, their layout has been (at the time of writing) 
published only in this Reddit [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/KeyboardLayouts/comments/1leon5u/keyboard_layout_advice_enpl/). I allow myself to quote it here: 
```
p g l m f  q o u y d
n s r t j  x a e i h
b c w z v  ? _ , . k
```
This exhibits many similarities to my layout presented above. And putting O above A seems like a good idea. I indeed tried putting O above E and didn't like it — the hand felt "undecided" and I would often 
mistype the two letters. However, with the vowel pair now being at the index finger this feels like the hand is indeed more "free" to switch between the two. Great job so far!

### Ideas

Putting ZT under middle finger seems also possible. See below for a sketch that hopefully allows SZCZ, STRZ, RZ, SZ, CZ, DZ and CH to be typed comfortably. This could possibly allow fitting H under left hand or reduce lateral stretches.

<!-- ... 

include inward rolls on some frequent-est Polish bigrams like IE, RZ, SZ, CZ, DZ. 
Others are a lateral stretch on HE (Colemak style) and same-finger HA, neither of which I find uncomfortable.

However, with the UU now being at index I imagine this comes across as the two vowels are now at index finger, the hand feels more mobile.
